## Project motivation
This project and the related blog post is part of Udacity Data Science nanodegree project. The data set for Airbnb Seatlle was obtained
on the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data
The direction I took in thid analysis is to view the data from an investor prespective on how to maximize their offereing price.

The findings are published on a blog post the can be accessed via the link : https://medium.com/@nwalid/how-canyou-benefit-most-from-renting-your-place-on-airbnb-seattle-c8fca41b4d1c

1. Readme.md (this file)
2. Seattle airbnb.ipynb (the python Notebook)
3. Listings.csv & Calendar.csv — https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data 

## Results
Through Data Analysis , Visualization and Modelling, the below have been concluded:

1- What time of the year should you put you home on Airbnb for maximum return? Summer months of June, July and August have the highest listing prices
2- What are the most in demand amenities for a typical listing? Free parking, Internet, TV, Washing and Drying facilities are most in demand amenities that positively influence the price of the space.
3- What neighborhoods provided the highest rental price? Alki, Briacliff and Beltton have the highest rental prices when compared with the other suburbs.
4- Deployment and evaluation of Machine learning Algorithm to predict prices : The deployed linear regression model had r2 of 0.32. Features that have the most effects on price prediction are: The location of space, the space is descriptive and the place is easy to be reached ie transit friendly.
